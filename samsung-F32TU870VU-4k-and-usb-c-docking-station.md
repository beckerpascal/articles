## Samsung F32TU870VU in combination with a USB-C laptop like the Apple MacBook Pro

At the beginning of November 2020 Samsung released its new professional screen with the type F32TU870VU. 
At the first glance, the screen looks like a standard 32" 4k screen, but at the second it is a really good companion to your USB-C laptop.

**Why?**

Because the screen can be used as a docking station. 
The amount of in- and outputs makes it possible to move away your Elgato (or any else) dock and use only the screen:
